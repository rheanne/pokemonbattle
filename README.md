A fun, local two-player Pokémon-style battle game built using **PyGame** and enhanced with sound effects using an additional Python audio library (such as `pygame.mixer` or `playsound`).

## 🎮 Game Overview

This is a 2-player game where each player controls a Pokémon character on the screen. Battle it out using keyboard controls and enjoy the retro-inspired experience with integrated sound effects.

- **Player 1 Controls (charizard)**:  
  `W` `A` `S` `D` to move their character and left-shift to shoot.

- **Player 2 Controls (pikachu)**:  
  Arrow keys (`↑` `↓` `←` `→`) to move their character and right-shift to shoot.

- **Sound Effects**:  
  Sound feedback is triggered by certain events (e.g. attacks, or collisions), implemented using an additional Python audio library.
